## Problem and Context

Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen (OEDK) opened in 2009 to assist undergraduate students at Rice University in designing solutions to real-world engineering problems. A variety of data such as daily access, 3D printer usage, and percentage of female users collected by OEDK over the past 12 years tells the story of how much progress it and the Rice Engineering program at large has made in student engagement and diversification. Yet, this raw data is not easily accessible, resulting in a lack of awareness regarding the achievements, availability of resources, and demographics of the space. Our goal is to design a dynamic, engaging and visually pleasing display that accurately models growing data available to increase awareness regarding the achievements and the inclusivity of the OEDK.

## Tools and Skills

Before undertaking this challenge, I had some experience with electronics having worked on some biosensor projects in high school. Through this project, I greatly expanded my skillset and technical toolbox, as the electronics and circuits were much more involved than my previous sensor circuits. I learned about I2C and SPI communication methods with electronic components, daisy chaining and multiplexing, integrating Internet of Things, and I learned SolidWorks CAD modeling. An aspect of the project I would like to learn more about is power calculations and how to ensure the circuit has enough power to drive all the electronics without destroying any of the electronics. Our faculty mentor provided some advice to add higher value resistors, however, I think some circuits draw too much power for this to make a difference. Furthermore, I learned about the different IEEE 802.11 standards for the Internet of Things. I learned how to host a server and database on a Raspberry PI. I learned how to power and drive a stepper motor, and how to calibrate it. I had some programming experience prior to this project, but I had not learned C++. Since I was prototyping the software component of the Arduino without the hardware while we were waiting for supplies to arrive, I learned C++ to test the software.

## Working in a Team

Through working on this project, I learned how to work with teammates and lead a technical project. I learned many lessons including working together to share ideas and brainstorm solutions, how to make decisions as a unit, how to plan and coordinate with team members, and how to execute on our plans as a team. I learned some of the challenges that teams encounter in an engineering context such as ensuring everyone is on the same page, addressing differences in technical experience, and integrating well together. I learned how to resolve conflicts and address any team member's concerns in a timely manner. I also learned how to teach technical skills to fellow teammates. For example, I showed my teammates how to solder electronics, interpret circuit diagrams, and interpret breadboard circuits to troubleshoot wiring issues.

## Engineering Design

From this experience, I learned how to follow the Engineering Design Process (EDP) and I saw first hand the importance of each stage of the EDP. We first clarified our team assignment and defined the problem statement. To objectively quantify success in this project, we then created a list of objectives and constraints for our final design solution using our initial interviews to support the design criteria categories and research to back up the target values. This stage of the EDP was critical to our next stages, as all of our decisions ultimately referred back to our criteria. Next, we brainstormed solutions, evaluated them, and developed low, medium, and high fidelity prototypes. We finally tested our prototypes, iterated, and produced a finished product for our client, the OEDK, to display proudly. Seeing how each stage built upon the previous one provides a sense of accomplishment seeing how far we have come from our initial concept. Since we stuck to the EDP throughout the entirety of our project, we ensured we exceeded our clients' expectations.
